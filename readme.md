## Introduction
This game is a simple platformer where the player controls a character (referred to as "blox") who can jump and shoot to defeat monster blocks. The goal is to avoid obstacles, defeat enemies, and reach the highest possible score.

## Installation
Requirements: Before running the game, make sure you have the following installed
Python (>= 3.6)
Pygame (for the game logic and rendering)
To install Pygame, you can use the following pip command:
pip install -r

## How to Play
Objective : Try to control the character to avoid obstacles that move from right to left, without letting the character fall or collide with any obstacles.
Controls :
- Press the Spacebar or click the mouse to make the character jump or fly upwards.
- The character will float up and gradually fall due to gravity.
- Avoid falling to the ground or colliding with obstacles.
Pass Obstacles : When you see a gap between obstacles, press the jump button at the right moment to pass through.

Game Over : 
- Colliding with Obstacles: If the character collides with an obstacle moving from the right, the game will end immediately.
- Falling to the Ground: If the character falls to the ground, the game will end as well.
- Restart: Once the game is over, you can restart by pressing the Restart button or Spacebar to play again.
